# code-os

**My personal operating system for code, knowledge, and lifelong learning.**

This is my single, central, evergreen repository — a living digital workspace where I continuously build, refine, and compound programming skills, engineering intuition, system understanding, problem-solving patterns, and real-world development thinking.

It's designed to last forever:
- No temporary folders or throwaway experiments — everything meaningful funnels here.
- Modular, searchable, and extensible — easy to revisit, expand, or reference years later.
- Public learning log — transparent commits, reflections, and growth visible to anyone curious.

## Core Principles

- **Compound daily** — Small, consistent inputs create exponential growth over time.
- **Evergreen first** — Notes, code, and patterns are written to remain useful indefinitely.
- **Learn in public** — Commits show real progress (warts and all); feedback welcome.
- **Single source of truth** — This repo is the canonical home for my dev knowledge base.

## What's Inside

High-level structure (evolves organically):

```
code-os/
├── core/                    # Foundational patterns, cheatsheets, timeless concepts
│   ├── algorithms/
│   ├── data-structures/
│   ├── system-design/
│   └── fundamentals/        # OOP, concurrency, networks, etc.
├── practice/                # Problem solving logs
│   ├── patterns/
│   ├── company-specific/
│   └── leetcode/
│   └── reflections/
├── projects/                # Real applications, tools, experiments
│   └── ...                  # Full-stack, libraries, side ideas
├── notes/                   # Deep dives, book summaries, architecture essays
├── resources/               # Curated links, tools, references
└── README.md                # You are here — the unchanging entry point
```

## How This Repo Works

- **Commits are intentional** — Meaningful messages, atomic changes, often with why/context.
- **Folders grow naturally** — No forced structure beyond the high-level buckets above.
- **Searchable** — Use GitHub search, tags, or grep to find anything quickly.
- **Versioned implicitly** — Git history preserves every stage of understanding.
- **Open for collaboration** — Fork, star, or open issues/PRs for corrections or additions.

## Core Stack

- **Java** — Main language for depth, clean code, and production thinking
- **Python** — Occasional scripts for quick experiments or data tasks
- **Focus** — Clean, readable, maintainable code with good comments where trade-offs matter

## For You

- **Recruiter** — This repo demonstrates consistent, long-term effort and structured thinking.
- **Fellow developer** — Fork what you like, or open an issue if you spot an improvement.
- **Future me** — Thank you for keeping this alive.

If you're on a similar lifelong learning path, feel free to star. We grow better together.
